#### Development will now focus on the [chained_bets](https://github.com/bws0013/chained_bets) branch.

This is a networking refresher for me. Just a simple client/server model. It enables the sending of files/directories from a client to a server.

The end goal here is effectively a 'friendly' botnet. A client could send files and code to a series of servers for testing. The goal is to be able to test code on lots of different machines.

The storage directory is not included here but is referenced a bunch in the code. Provide your own.

## Work in progress...
